               Step 1: Obtain Ubuntu

Go to the official Ubuntu website (https://ubuntu.com/) using your web browser.
Click on the "Download" tab.
Choose the version of Ubuntu you want to install (e.g., Ubuntu Desktop, Ubuntu Server) and click on the corresponding "Download" button.
Select the appropriate flavor (e.g., LTS or the latest release) and click on the "Download" button again.
                  Install Ubuntu
Restart your computer and make sure the USB drive is connected.
Enter the BIOS or UEFI settings of your computer by pressing the appropriate key during startup (e.g., F2, Del, Esc).
In the BIOS/UEFI settings, change the boot order to prioritize the USB drive.
Save the changes and exit the BIOS/UEFI settings.
Your computer should now boot from the USB drive and display the Ubuntu installer.
Select your language and click on the "Install Ubuntu" button.
Choose your keyboard layout and click on the "Continue" button.
On the "Updates and Other Software" screen, you can choose to install updates and third-party software during the installation process. Make your selection and click on "Continue."
On the "Installation Type" screen, select the installation option that suits your needs. If you're new to Ubuntu, the default option of "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" is recommended. You can also choose manual partitioning if you have specific requirements.
Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your time zone, keyboard layout, and user information.
Once you've entered all the necessary information, click on the "Install" button to begin the installation process.
The installer will copy the necessary files and configure your system. This may take some time.
After the installation is complete, you'll be prompted to restart your computer. Remove the USB drive before restarting.
